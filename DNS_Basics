DNS -> Domain Name System - naming system for resources connected to the Internet of network of computers

DNS server serves as an intermediary, translating user-friendly urls into ip addresses

DNS is decentralized to prevent any single-point failures

DNS Hierarchy: Root -> Top-Level-Domain -> Authoritative Name Servers -> Local DNS

Name Resolution:
  Iterative: returns reference to the DNS server higher in hierarchy
  Recursive: does all the work itself proceeding to each DNS of the higher rank

Whether a Query is Iterative or Recursive is decided by both Server and Client
