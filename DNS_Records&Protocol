Resource Records - entries stored in DNS zone file that provide information about a domain

RR = (name, value, type, TTL)

Types:
A - Address - contains IPv4 address of the hostname (AAAA -> IPv6)
NS - Name Server - authoritative name server for given domain (can be more than 1)
CNAME - Canonical Name - true/canonical domain name, requires more queries to resolve to an IP 
MX - Mail Server - mail server responsible for given domain

Query and Reply Protocol: (Find Structure at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)
  Identification: 16-bit number for query, reply uses the same number
  Flags: Reply//Query, Recursion: Desired//Available, Reply: Is_Authoritative?
  Size: Depends on number of RRs, Replies are Generally larger than Queries

  Components of Variable Lengths:

  Questions: name, type fields for a query
  Answers: RRs in response to query
  Authority: Records for authoritative servers
  Additional Information: possibly helpful information

DNS Caching: Local Name Servers will cache hostname-ip mapping once a query is made for a certain TTL, TLD servers are typically cached in DNS Local Name Servers to quicken the resolution
  Authoritative Name Server decides the DNS record TTL (e.g.: Netflix decides TTL for DNS)*
  Local Name Server re-queries when TTL expires
  Update/Notify follows IETF standard 

Record Insertion: Adding new records to DNS zone to manage information
  Process:
  1) Find DNS Registrar, to register the domain of your website
  2) Find Authoritative Name Servers, responsible for solving your domain name
  3) Insert DNS records (A type) into the Authoritative Name Server
  4) Insert DNS records (NS types) of your Authoritative Name Server to the TLD

DNS Registrar - company/organization that manages reservation of domain names on the internet, they mostly sell domain names

Possible Attacks:

DDOS - done by bombarding either root or TLD servers, the former is no longer possible due to traffic filtering
Redirect Attack (Man in the Middle) - intercept DNS queries, direct to a different/non-existant server, client will not be able to reach an actual server
DNS exploit for DDOS - send queries with spoofed source address (victim), amplify queries, DNS servers will reply to the victim and flood it, causing its domain to be inaccessible


*The TTL value determines how many network hops (routers) the packet can pass through before being discarded. Each router decrements the TTL value by one. When the TTL reaches zero,
 the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP “Time Exceeded” message back to the sender.
