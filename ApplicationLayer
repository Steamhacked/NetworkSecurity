Socket - endpoint that sends and receives data over network, consists of ip & port
Sockets - serve as an interface between application and transport layers, provide mechanism of sending/receiving data

Socket Types:
  1) Stream(TCP) - connection-oriented, provide reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of data
  2) Datagram(UDP) - connectionless, faster data delivery, but less reliable and does not guarantee error-checking

There are more than 1 applications, hence transport layer protocol utilizes multiplexing at sending end and demultiplexing at receiving end

Multiplexing - combining data from multiple application processes into a single stream of packets, (headers with source and port added to each packet)
Demultiplexing - examines packets and redirects data to the appropriate application processes

TCP segment -> kernel uses destination port, ip & source port & ip, to identify socket managing connection
UDP datagram -> kernel uses destination port & destination ip, to identify socket bound to ip/port
